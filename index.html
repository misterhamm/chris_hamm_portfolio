  <h1>Who Is This Guy?</h1>
  <p>
    I got my degree in music education in 2006.  Over the past nine years I have directed musicals, taught voice lessons, and managed about $10 million dollars in sales for an artisan bread company. After becoming disenchanted with jobs that were personally unfilling and taking me away from my family I decided to turn my hobby into a career.  Becoming a developer means the opportunity to embrace my creative roots while integrating my technological passions. It is a journey I am excited to be on.  <br><br>It'll be a wild ride.  Join me, won't you?

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>Family</h2>
  <p>
    My family is the <strong>most important</strong> thing in the world to me.  I've been married for (almost) 11 years and have three daughters who are 7, 6, and 3.  While I certainly want to find personal satisfaction in whatever I do in life, ultimately it all comes down to my ladies!  My wife is a fantastic singer and a member of <strong>Opera Grand Rapids</strong>.  Our oldest is an avid reader and fellow geek, #2 is talented at just about everything she touches, and the little one is probably the funniest person I've ever met.

  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <h2>
    So three kids...do you even have time for hobbies?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Nope.  Just kidding.  While calling myself a gamer would probably be an insult to real gamers I do love me some gaming.  Primarily I play modded Minecraft.  Other interests include craft beer, woodworking, sci-fi TV, and not exercising.  At any given time you can find me playing Minecraft while smelling of wood smoke and Old Spice and wearing a Star Trek t-shirt.  
  </p>
  <h2>
    What's your dream job?
  </h2>
  <p>
    This experiment with Thinkful is the first step for me.  I'd like to come out of the program able to get a FEWD job.  Given enough time and energy, however, I'd love to creep my way into software engineering and build things like <a href="http://www.jibo.com">this</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Where are you from?
  </h2>
  <p>
    My mom's vagina?
    <br></br>
    I live in <a href="http://www.experiencegr.com">Grand Rapids, MI</a>.  If you've never had a chance to visit Grand Rapids you need to do it now.  Seriously, shut your laptop, get off your ass and come here immediately.  I'll show you around, we can grab a beer.  We have all the amenities of a larger city with the Lake Michigan beach 45 minutes away.  It's a great place to live.
